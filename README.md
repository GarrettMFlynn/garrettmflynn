### Hi there 👋

My name is **Garrett Flynn**. I'm an Undergraduate Researcher @ [USC](https://usc.edu) studying remotely from 🐄 Eau Claire, WI.

My passion is neural interface engineering and integrating user feedback into early-stage neurotechnology design 🧠📲. If you like those topics feel free to say hi here or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/garrettmflynn) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/garrettmflynn).
